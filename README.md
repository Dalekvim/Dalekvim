Hi, my name is Vimal Vinod, I'm a collage student now. âœ¨<br>
I am currently working on a Django Blog<br>
which you can see
--><a href="https://dalekvim.herokuapp.com/blog/">here</a><-- ðŸŒ±<br>
(It was deployed for free on heroku so it might take a while to load up!).<br>

I'm still learning, so the blog isn't even remotely completed, but,<br>
bit by bit,<br>
I think I'm getting there.<br>

If you got any questions about anything I've made.<br>
or if you want to give me some advice,<br>
you can contact me on:

  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/dalekvim">twitter<a></li>
  <li>or on <a href="https://github.com/Dalekvim">github</a>! (I think ðŸ¤”)</li>
</ul>
